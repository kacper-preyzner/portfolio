          <h2>Kacper Preyzner</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! I'm Kacper, a passionate full-stack web developer with
            expertise in both frontend and backend technologies. I'm currently
            focused on creating intuitive and responsive web applications that
            provide exceptional user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a strong foundation in computer science, I enjoy solving
            complex problems and turning ideas into functional, beautiful
            digital products. My approach combines technical expertise with
            creative thinking to deliver solutions that exceed expectations.
          </p>
          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science, where I've
            been honing my skills through various projects and coursework.
          </p>
          <h3>My Journey</h3>
          <p>
            My interest in web development began during my early college years
            when I started exploring how websites work. What started as
            curiosity quickly turned into a passion as I began creating my own
            projects and learning various technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
            contributing to open-source projects, or expanding my knowledge
            through online courses and tech communities.
